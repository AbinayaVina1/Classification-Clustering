# Classification and Clustering Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing **Classification and Clustering** using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The notebook demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing
- Classification using various models (e.g., KNN)
- Clustering algorithms (e.g., KMeans)
- Evaluation using metrics like Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report
- Visualizations for insights and model performance

## File Structure

- `Classification&Clustering.ipynb`: Main notebook containing all the analysis and results.
